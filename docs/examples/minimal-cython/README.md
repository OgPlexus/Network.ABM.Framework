# Minimal Infectious Disease Model

- Run `python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace` to compile Cython modules
- Run `python3 simRunner.py` to simulate the network
- Change values in `probabilities.py` and network size in `simRunner.py` (line 10) and run again to see how the results change. You do not need to recompile if you change just these files.
